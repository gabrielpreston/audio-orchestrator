# Discord Voice Lab

The Discord Voice Lab packages a voice-first Discord assistant alongside speech-to-text (STT),
language-orchestrator, and text-to-speech (TTS) services. The bot captures voice from Discord,
streams audio to faster-whisper, coordinates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and plays back
synthesized responses.

## Run the Stack

2. Launch the stack with Docker Compose following the [runtime quickstart](docs/getting-started/runtime.md).
3. Explore linting, testing, and iterative workflows via [local development workflows](docs/getting-started/local-development.md).

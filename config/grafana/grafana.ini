# Grafana configuration override for JSON logging
# This file sets log format to JSON when LOG_JSON=true (mapped by entrypoint script)
# The entrypoint script creates this file dynamically based on LOG_JSON environment variable

[log]
# Format: console or json
# Defaults to console if LOG_JSON is not true
format = console

# Mode: console, file, or both
mode = console

# Level: debug, info, warn, error, critical
# Set via GF_LOG_LEVEL environment variable (defaults to info)
# level = info

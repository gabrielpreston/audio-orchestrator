# Voice Agent Command Reference [PLACEHOLDER]

## Purpose
A comprehensive reference for all voice commands the agent supports — their syntax, intent mapping, and behavior. Also explains how commands are parsed and routed internally.

---

## 1. Command Catalog

| Example Command | Intent | Description |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| "Create a new file" | `create_file` | Creates a new source file |
| "Run the tests" | `run_tests` | Executes unit and integration tests |
| "Deploy the app" | `deploy` | Triggers the deployment pipeline |

> ✅ TODO: Populate with all supported commands as they are implemented.

---

## 2. Intent Schema
> ✅ TODO: Document the intent structure and fields used internally.

---

## 3. Adding New Commands
> ✅ TODO: Explain how to register a new command and link it to downstream logic.

# Project Roadmap

## Integrated Voice-Driven DevOps Roadmap

**North Star:**
Evolve the Discord voice lab into an **agnostic multi-tool AI development agent** that understands
speech, selects the right execution surface (Cursor, alternative MCP tools, or a local workspace),
executes workflows across GitHub, Monday.com, and AWS, and reliably closes the SDLC loop from
ideation to deployment.

This roadmap blends the original 14-day acceleration plan with the cross-domain workflows captured
in the MCP user journey proposal so we can deliver a cohesive, voice-first DevOps assistant.

---

## 1. Strategic Themes

1. [ ] **Voice as Intent Interface** — Maintain low-latency, high-accuracy transcription and intent
   framing so spoken requests seamlessly translate into executable plans.
2. [ ] **Tool-Agnostic Execution Fabric** — Maintain adapters that let the orchestrator swap
   seamlessly between Cursor, other MCP editing environments, or local tooling for code edits, test
   runs, and git flows while Discord provides the conversational shell.
3. [ ] **Adaptive Orchestrator Runtime** — Reinforce the existing FastAPI path with Redis-backed
   state, structured streaming, and OpenTelemetry so MCP tools stay portable across managed and
   self-hosted contexts while replicating today’s cadence, persona prompts, and payload contracts.
4. [ ] **Persona-Locked Orchestration** — Anchor the LLM orchestrator in a consistent
   project-manager/personal-assistant persona that plans, delegates, and confirms while routing
   specialized work to clearly defined expert personas (e.g., reviewer, deployer).
5. [ ] **MCP Workflow Mesh** — Treat MCP tools as modular building blocks that let the orchestrator
   span GitHub, Monday.com, AWS, and Discord text channels without bespoke integrations per
   workflow.
6. [ ] **Stateful Follow-through** — Persist intent, action status, and accountability trails inside
   Monday.com so every workflow has a living source of truth that captures ownership, due dates,
   escalation paths, and closure evidence.
7. [ ] **Progressive Safety, Memory, and Governance** — Apply only the minimal confirmations needed
   for core functionality early on, then layer deeper role checks, audit logs, and hardening toward
   the end of the program when broader adoption is imminent.

## 2. Execution Horizon

The plan is structured into three execution waves that layer foundational capabilities, workflow
automation, and operational maturity. Each wave includes platform work plus the user-journey
deliverables required to unlock business value.

### Wave 1 — Platform Stabilization (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Harden the voice/MCP core so it can support multi-service workflows.

Platform investments:

- [x] Stand up GitHub Actions CI with lint, test, docker smoke, and security
  scanning aligned to the Makefile workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).
- [ ] Finalize PCM → STT → transcript pipeline for both Discord and optional local mic ingestion,
  with retry/backoff controls already present in the bot code.
- [ ] Stand up a Redis-backed orchestrator sandbox and companion Make target that proxies Discord
  transcripts, captures event payloads, parity gaps, and benchmarks end-to-end latency deltas versus
  the current local Llama loop.
- [ ] Introduce Redis conversation and tool-state storage plus structured streaming envelopes
  instrumented with OpenTelemetry to deliver the Option A progress events.
- [ ] Introduce a lightweight intent schema that maps speech into structured actions (e.g.,
  read-only status queries vs. write actions requiring confirmation).
- [ ] Implement short-term conversation memory to carry entity references across turns (“Move the
  API hardening task”).
- [ ] Build lightweight confirmation heuristics for state-changing operations before touching
  external systems so the project-manager persona verifies intent without blocking iteration; defer
  robust policy enforcement to Wave 3.
- [ ] Capture a parity ledger that inventories today’s orchestrator behaviors (persona prompts,
  payload schema, streaming cadence, fallback messaging) and annotate which elements the Redis
  runtime must emulate during sandbox and rollout phases.
- [ ] Stand up a Monday.com-linked state ledger that records intent, current status, assignee,
  follow-up checkpoints, and agreed escalation cadences for every orchestrated workflow.
- [ ] Publish a capability registry that maps development actions to available tooling (Cursor
  sessions, alternative MCP editors, or local execution) with health signals so the orchestrator can
  choose the appropriate implementation detail at run time and flag functionality gaps to backfill
  before full migration.

User journey enablement:

- [ ] **Monday.com sprint planning basics** — Ship MCP tools for `monday.board_summary`,
  `monday.update_item`, and `monday.create_update`, plus a Discord text bridge (`discord.message`)
  for channel notifications. Automatically tag affected items with the originating Discord channel,
  ensure every voice request assigns or reaffirms an owner and due date, and log confirmation
  prompts so follow-ups are visible on the board.
- [ ] **GitHub status readouts** — Deliver authenticated MCP coverage for
  `github.list_pull_requests` and `github.get_check_runs`, including pagination and retry behavior.
  Capture unresolved review questions as Monday.com action items linked to the PR.
- [ ] **AWS observability hooks** — Provide `aws.cloudwatch_get_metric` for latency triage with rate
  limiting and structured incident payloads. Mirror incident triage sessions into Monday.com
  timelines with automatic reminders for validation tasks.
- [ ] **Runtime sandbox evaluation** — Document setup, env keys, parity checklists, and regression
  results for the Redis runtime so Discord reviewers can compare streaming behavior before rollout.

Milestone definition of done:

- [ ] Spoken sprint summaries, PR status reports, and latency snapshots can be requested end-to-end
  via Discord voice with safety prompts for write actions.

### Wave 2 — Workflow Automation (Weeks 3-5)

**Goal:** Expand from read-heavy interactions to action-oriented, chained workflows spanning Monday,
GitHub, and AWS.

Platform investments:

- [ ] Extend MCP toolset with write actions:
  `github.create_comment`, `aws.autoscaling_set_desired_capacity`, Monday.com incident templates,
  and Discord embeds for rich responses, relying on playbook confirmations while postponing deeper
  control-plane hardening to the final wave.
- [ ] Add a feature-flagged Redis state and streaming layer inside `services/llm` that registers
  existing MCP tooling, emits structured progress events, and falls back to the local Llama runtime
  when Redis or telemetry paths are unavailable while replaying transcript fixtures to confirm the new
  path replicates the legacy orchestration contract.
- [ ] Teach the capability registry to rank and select execution tools based on latency,
  availability, and required affordances (e.g., batch refactors vs. quick edits) so workflows stay
  portable if Cursor is unavailable or a local-only stack is preferred.
- [ ] Stand up a checklist manifest engine that declaratively encodes multi-step flows (release
  handoff, incident response) with success criteria, branching logic, and persona responsibilities so
  the orchestrator can call in reviewer/deployer experts when needed, matching the automation hooks
  already exercised in the local ecosystem.
- [ ] Add repository/workspace scoping metadata so the orchestrator selects the correct GitHub repo
  or Monday board based on channel context.
- [ ] Extend regression harnesses with golden Discord transcripts and tool outputs so the Redis path
  and the legacy runtime produce equivalent responses before flipping the default runtime.
- [ ] Layer CI log summarization skills to convert check-run output into concise voice narratives
  with links back to raw artifacts.
- [ ] Expand the Monday.com state ledger into a lifecycle tracker that captures planned actions,
  execution timestamps, persona hand-offs, and outstanding follow-ups, including escalations when
  deadlines lapse.

User journey enablement:

- [ ] **Sprint planning with updates** — Support status transitions and note creation with
  confirmation prompts and conversation memory while appending subitems that list every requested
  follow-up task plus owner, due date, and escalation trigger.
- [ ] **GitHub code review assistant** — Allow follow-up questions on failing PRs, summarizing CI
  logs, and posting review comments with policy checks. When blockers remain, auto-create Monday.com
  tasks referencing the PR comment thread and assign them to the responsible persona/owner with
  reminder cadences.
- [ ] **AWS incident response** — Execute autoscaling adjustments with guard rails, generate Discord
  embeds for incident context, and log incidents into Monday.com with tagging conventions, status
  transitions, reminder loops, and post-incident verification checklists so nothing drops.
- [ ] **Dual-mode orchestrator rollout** — Ship structured logs, regression tests, transcript replay
  harnesses, and documentation covering Redis runtime enablement, fallback behavior, and operational
  dashboards.

Milestone definition of done:

- [ ] Voice-driven requests can modify Monday.com items, comment on PRs, and perform scoped AWS
  changes while producing multimodal feedback (speech + Discord text/embeds).

### Wave 3 — Operational Maturity (Weeks 6-8)

**Goal:** Deliver a cohesive, auditable DevOps copilot capable of orchestrating release handoffs and
continuous improvement loops.

Platform investments:

- [ ] Integrate comprehensive access governance:
  role verification before deployment-sensitive actions, plus audit logs for all MCP calls that
  document which persona executed the step and what approvals were gathered, completing the deferred
  hardening investments.
- [ ] Expand conversation memory into session-level context with persistence hooks for postmortem
  review.
- [ ] Run Redis-vs-local bakeoffs on representative release and incident scripts, documenting any
  residual gaps and sign-offs required before removing the local executor.
- [ ] Implement blocker escalation logic that routes unresolved items into follow-up workflows
  (task creation, paging) without losing context, guided by the project-manager persona’s escalation
  play.
- [ ] Wire git automation (branching, commits, PR scaffolding) into the voice interface with
  reversible operations and summary diffs.
- [ ] Provide an onboarding kit for new development tools, including manifest templates and
  validation harnesses, so the capability registry can add or swap execution surfaces without
  destabilizing the orchestrator.
- [ ] Promote the Redis-backed orchestrator runtime to the default path, remove the legacy Llama
  dependency, and harden observability, failover messaging, and documentation for production use once
  parity checklists clear across sandbox, dual-mode, and production transcripts.
- [ ] Provide Monday.com cadences that track release readiness artifacts, attach generated reports,
  and notify owners when voice-driven tasks remain incomplete, including automated reminders and
  escalations when response SLAs slip.

User journey enablement:

- [ ] **Cross-service release handoff** — Use the checklist manifest to run release readiness checks
  (GitHub deployments, Monday blockers, AWS preflight) and produce Markdown reports via
  `discord.message`. Archive the full run (inputs, MCP calls, confirmations) into the Monday.com
  release board for audit and future retros, including the persona roster that handled each step.
- [ ] **Team-aware collaboration** — Allow the agent to brief teams, generate meeting-ready
  summaries, and surface blockers proactively through Discord text bridges. Sync those summaries to
  Monday.com dashboards so async participants can pick up next steps without voice context, tagging
  accountable owners and reminding them until closure.
- [ ] **Continuous improvement hooks** — Capture incident learnings and roadmap updates to seed
  future conversations and memory, linking lessons learned to living Monday.com improvement tasks so
  they remain actionable and assigned.
- [ ] **Redis-runtime operations** — Demonstrate that the Redis-backed runtime meets latency targets,
  auditability expectations, and fallback protocols across release handoff, collaboration, and
  improvement workflows while keeping voice UX consistent.

Milestone definition of done:

- [ ] Release handoffs run via a single voice request, produce auditable reports, escalate blockers,
  and maintain safe operations through confirmations and role checks.

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Tool choice is contextual:** Route code edits and git flows through the best-fit workspace
  (Cursor, other MCP editors, or a local stack) while keeping every action inspectable.
- **Voice expresses intent, not raw text:** Convert speech into structured plans that tools execute.
- **Deterministic tools, reasoning orchestrator:** Keep the LLM focused on planning while MCP tools
  deliver side-effecting operations.
- **Stage observability and safety:** Add the minimum confirmations/logs to keep early features
  trustworthy, then expand into full audit trails and governance as adoption broadens.
- **Multimodal feedback:** Pair spoken responses with Discord text/embeds for metrics, diffs, and
  incident artifacts while treating Monday.com as the canonical ledger for follow-ups.
- **Persona clarity:** Make the project-manager/personal-assistant orchestrator narrate delegations,
  confirm accountability, and explicitly call on expert personas when workflows demand deep focus.

---

## 4. Stretch Initiatives (Beyond 2 Months)

- [ ] **Persistent memory and personalization** — Track architectural decisions, coding style, and
  past incidents to adapt future reasoning.
- [ ] **Multi-agent specializations** — Introduce planner/reviewer/deployer personas that
  collaborate through shared manifests.
- [ ] **Proactive operations** — Allow the agent to monitor metrics, detect anomalies, and surface
  suggestions without explicit prompts.
- [ ] **Onboarding playbooks** — Package demo flows, environment setup, and troubleshooting guides so
  new teams can adopt the system quickly.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

By the end of Wave 3 the agent can:

- [ ] Accept spoken requests, plan multi-service workflows, execute MCP actions, and surface results
  via voice and Discord text without manual intervention.
- [ ] Demonstrate auditability and safety guardrails acceptable for production incident and release
  management.
- [ ] Provide clear documentation and manifests that let new contributors extend the workflow mesh
  with additional MCP tools or domains.

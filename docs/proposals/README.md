# Proposal Index

Track design discussions and decisions across the voice lab.

## Submission Guidelines

-  Add YAML front matter including `title`, `author`, `status`, and `last-updated`.
-  Use the status lifecycle: `draft` → `in-review` → `accepted` or `rejected`.
-  Link accepted proposals to the relevant architecture, operations, or roadmap docs.
-  Update this index whenever the status of a proposal changes.

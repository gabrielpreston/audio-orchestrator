# Multi-Surface Architecture Proposal

> **⚠️ DRAFT PROPOSAL** - This document describes aspirational features and future extensions for the Composable Surface Architecture. These features are not currently implemented and represent proposed enhancements to the existing system.

## Overview

This proposal outlines advanced features and extensions for the Composable Surface Architecture, building upon the current Discord implementation to support multi-surface sessions, advanced integration patterns, and enhanced capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation provides:

- ✅ Core interfaces (AudioSource, AudioSink, ControlChannel, SurfaceLifecycle)
- ✅ Discord surface adapter implementation
- ✅ Basic event system
- ✅ Registry system
- ✅ Media gateway
- ✅ Error handling and performance requirements

## Proposed Architecture Principles

### 1. **Composability**

- Surface adapters are composed of four independent components: AudioSource, AudioSink, ControlChannel, and SurfaceLifecycle
- Each component can be implemented independently and swapped without affecting others
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces

### 2. **Extensibility**

- New surface types can be added by implementing the four core interfaces
- Existing surfaces can be enhanced without breaking changes
- Plugin architecture supports third-party surface implementations

### 3. **Consistency**

- All surfaces provide consistent behavior through standardized interfaces
- Common patterns for error handling, configuration, and lifecycle management
- Unified event system across all surface types

## Proposed Integration Patterns

### 1. **Surface Registration**

```python
# Register a new surface
registry = SurfaceRegistry()
registry.register_surface("discord", DiscordSurfaceAdapter())
registry.register_surface("webrtc", WebRTCSurfaceAdapter())
```

### 2. **Adapter Composition**

```python
# Compose surface adapters
surface = SurfaceAdapter(
    audio_source=DiscordAudioSource(),
    audio_sink=DiscordAudioSink(),
    control_channel=DiscordControlChannel(),
    surface_lifecycle=DiscordSurfaceLifecycle()
)
```

### 3. **Event Routing**

```python
# Route events between components
control_channel.register_event_handler("wake_detected", handle_wake_word)
audio_source.register_frame_handler(process_audio_frame)
```

### 4. **Lifecycle Management**

```python
# Manage surface lifecycle
await surface_lifecycle.connect()
await audio_source.initialize()
await audio_sink.initialize()
await control_channel.initialize()
```

## Proposed Future Extensions

### Planned Surface Types

- **WebRTC/LiveKit**: Real-time communication surfaces
- **Mobile SDK**: Native mobile app integration
- **IoT Devices**: Smart home device integration
- **Telephony**: Phone system integration

### Advanced Features

- **Multi-Surface Sessions**: Simultaneous multiple surface connections
- **Surface Switching**: Dynamic surface switching during sessions
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution across multiple surface instances
- **Failover**: Automatic failover between surface instances

## Proposed Migration Guide

### From Monolithic to Composable

1. **Identify Surface Components**: Break down existing surface code into the four core interfaces
2. **Implement Adapters**: Create adapter classes for each interface
3. **Update Integration**: Replace direct surface calls with adapter calls
4. **Test Migration**: Run contract and parity tests to validate migration

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing surface implementations continue to work
- Gradual migration path with feature flags
- Compatibility layer for legacy interfaces

## Proposed Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Surface-specific authentication mechanisms
- Token-based authentication for API surfaces
- Certificate-based authentication for secure connections

### Data Privacy

- Audio data encryption in transit
- No persistent audio storage
- Secure event transmission

### Access Control

- Surface-level permissions
- User-based access control
- Session-based authorization

## Proposed Monitoring and Observability

### Health Monitoring

- Connection status monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate tracking
- Latency monitoring

### Debugging Support

- Detailed logging with correlation IDs
- Event tracing across components
- Performance profiling
- Error diagnostics

## Implementation Checklist

# Cursor CI Integration — Minimal Approach

## The Problem with Previous Approaches

Both the over-engineered and "simplified" approaches were still too complex because they assumed:
1. Cursor CLI `fix-ci` command exists
2. We know its API/interface
3. We need complex GitHub Actions workflows
4. We need extensive documentation

## Reality Check

**What we actually know:**
- Cursor has a CLI (existence confirmed)
- There might be a `fix-ci` command (unconfirmed)
- We don't know the actual interface/API
- We don't know what it can actually fix

**What we're doing wrong:**
- Building complex infrastructure for unknown functionality
- Creating extensive documentation for non-existent features
- Over-engineering the integration approach

## Minimal Viable Approach

### 1. Wait for Actual CLI

Don't build anything until we know:
- Does `cursor fix-ci` actually exist?
- What's the real API/interface?
- What can it actually fix?

### 2. Simple Makefile Target (When Available)

```makefile
cursor-fix: ## Apply Cursor fixes (when CLI is available)
	@cursor fix-ci --auto-commit
```

### 3. Basic GitHub Actions (When Available)

```yaml
name: Cursor Fix CI
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI"]
    types: [completed]
jobs:
  fix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Cursor CLI
        run: curl -fsSL https://cursor.sh/install.sh | sh
      - name: Apply fixes
        run: cursor fix-ci --auto-commit
```

## What to Remove

### Delete These Files
- ❌ `services/cursor-fixer/` (entire directory)
- ❌ Complex GitHub Actions workflows
- ❌ Extensive documentation
- ❌ Makefile targets for non-existent CLI

### Keep Only
- ✅ Basic placeholder workflow (minimal)
- ✅ Simple documentation of the concept
- ✅ Wait for actual CLI availability

## Current Status

**What we have:** Nothing useful (CLI doesn't exist yet)
**What we need:** Wait for Cursor to release `fix-ci` functionality
**What to do:** Delete the over-engineered code and wait

## Next Steps

1. **Delete over-engineered files**
2. **Create minimal placeholder**
3. **Wait for actual Cursor CLI `fix-ci`**
4. **Implement simple integration when available**

## Conclusion

The entire approach was premature. We should wait for the actual Cursor CLI `fix-ci` functionality to exist before building any integration.

# Development Guide [PLACEHOLDER]

## Purpose
This guide explains the *day-to-day developer workflow* for contributing to this project. It focuses on practical details — how to run services locally, debug issues, and safely extend the system — beyond the conceptual overview provided in `ONBOARDING.md`.

---

## 1. Local Environment Setup
> ✅ TODO: Fill in prerequisites, setup commands, and tooling versions.
- Required dependencies (Go, Python, virtualenv, ffmpeg, etc.)
- Environment setup steps
- How to start each local service (bot, STT, LLM, TTS)

---

## 2. Recommended Dev Commands
> ✅ TODO: Add commonly used Make targets and CLI commands.

---

## 3. Running Components in Isolation
> ✅ TODO: Explain how to run each pipeline stage independently for debugging.

---

## 4. Debugging & Troubleshooting
> ✅ TODO: Add tips for diagnosing common errors (no audio, STT timeout, TTS not responding, etc.)

---

## 5. Testing & QA
> ✅ TODO: Add testing instructions, structure, and tips for writing new tests.

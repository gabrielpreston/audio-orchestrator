# AI Agent Vision & Strategy [PLACEHOLDER]

## Purpose
This document captures the long-term mission, design philosophy, and future evolution of the AI agent. It’s meant to align contributors on *why* this project exists and where it’s headed.

---

## 1. Mission Statement
> ✅ TODO: Describe the project’s ultimate goal — a voice-powered AI that can iterate, write, test, build, and ship code collaboratively.

---

## 2. Strategic Principles
- Autonomy: The agent should become increasingly capable of self-directed actions.
- Transparency: All decisions and code changes should be explainable and observable.
- Extensibility: Components must remain swappable and composable.
- Collaboration: Human-in-the-loop workflows should be first-class citizens.

---

## 3. Long-Term Roadmap
> ✅ TODO: Add 6-12 month vision for feature evolution, integrations (e.g., GitHub, Jira, CI/CD), and agentic workflows.
